# Cursor Inspector

Cursor Inspector is a sample script for Google Docs that allows you to inspect
the current state of the cursor or selection within a document. The information
is presented in a sidebar and updates automatically every few seconds. The data
presented corresponds with the
[`Cursor`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/cursor)
and
[`Selection`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/selection)
classes of the API.
