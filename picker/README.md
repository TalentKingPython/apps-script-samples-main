# File Picker Sample

This sample shows how to create a "file-open" dialog in Google Sheets that
allows the user to select a file from their Drive. It does so by loading
[Google Picker](https://developers.google.com/picker/), a standard G Suite
client-side API for this purpose. More information is available in the Apps
Script guide
[Dialogs and Sidebars in Google Workspace Documents](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs#file-open_dialogs).

Note that this sample expects to be
[bound](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/bound)
to a spreadsheet.
